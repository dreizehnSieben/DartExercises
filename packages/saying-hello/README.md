# Saying Hello

The "Hello, World" program is the first program you learn to write in many languages, but it doesn't involve any input.

So create a proram that prompts for your name and prints a greeting using your name.

## Example Output

```
What is your name? Brian
Hello, Brian, nice to meet you!
```

## Constraints

- Keep the input, string concatenation, and output separate.
